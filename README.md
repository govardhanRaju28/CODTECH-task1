objective:
This project implements Linear Regression to predict a target variable based on multiple input features from a dataset. The focus is on training a regression model, evaluating its performance using metrics, and analyzing the results.

### **Overview of the Project**  

This project implements **Linear Regression** to predict a target variable based on multiple input features from a dataset. The focus is on training a regression model, evaluating its performance using metrics, and analyzing the results.  



### **Key Points**  

1. **Objective:**  
   - Use machine learning to predict a target variable (dependent variable) using multiple independent variables (features).  
   - Analyze the model's performance with metrics like **R-squared score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  

2. **Steps Involved:**  
   - Load and preprocess a real-world dataset (`Real estate.csv`).  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  
   - Train a **Linear Regression** model on the training data.  
   - Use the trained model to predict results on unseen test data.  
   - Evaluate how well the model performs using statistical measures.  

3. **Performance Metrics:**  
   - **R-Squared Score:** Checks how well the model explains the variability in the data.  
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.  

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Visual plots can be added to compare the actual and predicted values for better interpretation of results.  



### **Technologies Used**  

1. **Python:** Programming language for implementing the solution.  
2. **Pandas:** For data loading and manipulation.  
3. **NumPy:** For numerical operations.  
4. **Scikit-learn:**  
   - **Model Selection:** Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - **Linear Regression:** Builds and trains the regression model.  
   - **Metrics:** Evaluates the model using R-squared and MSE.  
5. **Matplotlib:** Used to visualize results.
